# President
A turn based simulation game in Processing: You've just won the 2016 presidential election! Now you have to do the work, new Commander-In-Chief.

Initial setup:

  The game begins on January 20th, 2017. You have been able to pick a party (Democrat or Republican) and your general starting liberal or conservative tendancy. In the default mode both houses of Congress are narrowly lead by your party, but that may change in two years, and you'll get to know the party leadership along the way.

Gameplay:

  Each turn is a week. At the beginning you will get a briefing from your cabinet, each member possibly giving one most important relevant current event (They may repeat if not resolved). Possible that not all members will give news, because many are less important. 
    The positions are: VP, Sec. of State, Sec. of Treasury, Sec. of War, Sec. of Commerce, Attorney General, Sec. of the Interior, Sec. of Agriculture, Sec. of Labor, Sec. of Health, Sec. of Housing and Urban Dev., Sec. of Transportation, Sec. of Energy, Sec. of VA, Sec. of Education, Sec. of Homeland Security.
