# President
A turn based simulation game in Processing: You've just won the 2016 presidential election! Now you have to do the work, new Commander-In-Chief.

Initial setup:

  The game begins on January 20th, 2017. You have been able to pick a party (Democrat or Republican) and your general starting liberal or conservative tendancy. In the default mode both houses of Congress are narrowly lead by your party, but that may change in two years, and you'll get to know the party leadership along the way.

Gameplay:

  Each turn is a week. At the beginning you will get a briefing from your cabinet, each member possibly giving one most important relevant current event (They may repeat if not resolved). Possible that not all members will give news, because many are less important. You will also get an update on any bills you have affected.
    The positions are: Sec. of State, Sec. of Treasury, Sec. of War, Sec. of Commerce, Attorney General, Sec. of the Interior, Sec. of Agriculture, Sec. of Labor, Sec. of Health, Sec. of Housing and Urban Dev., Sec. of Transportation, Sec. of Energy, Sec. of VA, Sec. of Education, Sec. of Homeland Security.
  
  Here's a list of things you can do each turn:
    - Perform a speech to either or both houses of congress. Both houses have committee bill proposals at the floor with known yea and nay votes at most times.
      * Bills are on the floor 2 turns before getting a vote, but talking to the speaker or VP can get it moved forward or back.
      * You may pick maximum 2 each turn to support (you may be forced to support extra if you made a deal)
      * You may pick maximum 2 each turn to denounce (and whether you threaten to veto it, which will add nay votes but increase the possibility of an override)
      * To make a law, a bill must be brought to committee in the House. This can be done automatically or through you. Then it needs to pass in the House. It is brought to the Senate (small chance it doesn't), where it needs to pass. If it passes both houses it gets to you and you can choose whether to sign or veto. If you veto, in the next turn both houses will vote to override, which will happen with a two thirds vote (290/435 and 67/100) and then you will need to sign.
    - You may pick a bill to send (through a representative) to a committee that you hope will eventually get to you to sign into law. You can create a bill that has up to 3 ideas in it (each could possibly make it more toxic, so be careful).
    - You may talk to all legislators in your party privately to support up to 5 specific ideas (not bills). They may leak the information.
    - You may talk to legislators during a turn, though there is a small chance they will not talk to you. Things you can say:
      * Make a deal with them. You will support or denounce a bill in front of congress and they will vote yea or nay on any bill. You will see a list of yay and nay votes by them and bills they have expressed support for.
